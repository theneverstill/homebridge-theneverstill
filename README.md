# Homebridge Plugin TheNeverStill

Homebridge plugin to add critical functionality to your HomeKit home.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What does this plugin do? // Why would I use this plugin?**

1. Automations that trigger every 15 seconds (rather than 5 minutes) and are standard automation triggers instead of timer automations (meaning you can add additional triggers and conditions).
   - E.g. [TNS Clock](#tns-clock "TNS Clock")
1. Unresponsive device detection
   - E.g. [Unresponsive Device Alarm](#unresponsive-device-alarm "Unresponsive Device Alarm")
1. Digital switches with optional reset timers
   - E.g. [Ideal State Switch](#ideal-state-switch "Ideal State Switch")
   - E.g. [Motion Sensor Cooldown Switch](#motion-sensor-cooldown-switch "Motion Sensor Cooldown Switch")
1. Digital security alarms
   - E.g. [Unresponsive Device Alarm](#unresponsive-device-alarm "Unresponsive Device Alarm")
1. Annoying security alarms

**Isn't this plugin just a combination of other plugins?**

Yes and no. While it is true that there are several other plugins that, when put together, add _most_ of the same functionality, there are three critical differences:

1. `homebridge-theneverstill` allows you to combine related Homebridge devices all under one accessory. This is not only cleaner, but also:
2. With all related devices under one accessory, you can fully leverage the benefits of child bridges _on each accessory_. Per Homebridge: `This can improve the general responsiveness and reliability of Homebridge.`
3. (Coming soon!) This plugin will be [verified by Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/verified "Verified By Homebridge"). Many plugins with related functionality are not, so you are left with a lower guarantee of bug fixes and enhancements.

### Recommended Accessories

#### TNS Clock

The purpose of this accessory is to allow you to trigger automations every 15 seconds.

- At the time of writing this line a HomeKit timer automation's smallest increment is 5 minutes
  - Additionally, timer automations do not support conditions
- 15 seconds is the recommended setup for this accessory - you can decrease this number, but bear in mind this is untested behavior

1. Create an accessory with the following configuration ([see 'Add Accessories' steps above](#add-accessories "How to Add Accessories")):

   - Use default values for all properties not explicitly noted below.

   ```json
   {
   "name": "TNS Clock",
   "switchOneIsCreatable": true,
   "switchOneDefaultStateRevertTime": 15000,
   "switchTwoIsCreatable": true,
   "switchTwoDefaultStateRevertTime": 15000,
   },
   ```

1. Set the `TNS Clock` accessory to run a child bridge

   - The purpose of setting this accessory to run as a child bridge, per Homebridge: `This can improve the general responsiveness and reliability of Homebridge.`

   1. Log in to your Homebridge deployment and navigate to the `Plugins` tab
   1. Find the plugin card for `Homebridge TheNeverStill`
   1. Click the `wrench` (ðŸ”§) button
   1. Click the `Bridge Settings` dropdown option
   1. Toggle `on` the switch beside the `TNS Clock` accessory
   1. Click the `SAVE` button

1. Restart Homebridge

1. Add the `TNS Clock` accessory to HomeKit

   1. Log in to your Homebridge deployment and navigate to the `Plugins` tab
   1. Find the plugin card for `Homebridge TheNeverStill`
   1. Click the `wrench` (ðŸ”§) button
   1. Click the `Bridge Settings` dropdown option
   1. Open your HomeKit app (e.g. `Home`, `Eve`, `Controller for HomeKit`) and add a HomeKit Accessory using the QR code displayed under the `TNS Clock` accessory
      1. On the `Uncertified Accessory` prompt click the `Add Anyway` button
      1. Select or create a room, e.g. `Homebridge` Room
      1. Name the child bridge, e.g. `TNS Clock Bridge`
      1. Name the accessory (defined as a switch), e.g. `TNS Clock Switches`
      1. Name the accessory switches
      1. e.g. `TNS Clock Tick Switch`
      1. e.g. `TNS Clock Tock Switch`

1. Add the `TNS Clock` scenes and automations

   1. `Turn on TNS Clock Tick Switch Scene`
      - Type: `Scene`
      - Name: `Turn on TNS Clock Tick Switch Scene`
      - Action: `Turn on TNS Clock Tick Switch`
   1. `Turn on TNS Clock Tock Switch Scene`
      - Type: `Scene`
      - Name: `Turn on TNS Clock Tock Switch Scene`
      - Action: `Turn on TNS Clock Tock Switch`
   1. `TNS Clock Heartbeat Automation`
      - Purpose: If your hub or Homebridge become unresponsive for an extended period of time Tick and Tock will stop working. This automation ensures Tick and Tock restart whenever your hub or Homebridge become responsive again. Additionally this automation resets Tick and Tock drift every 5 minutes.
      - Type: `Timer Automation`
      - The `Home` app does not support timer automations. You must use a more advanced HomeKit app (e.g. `Eve`, `Controller for HomeKit`) to create them.
      - Name: `TNS Clock Heartbeat Automation`
      - Repeat: `every 5 minutes`
      - Starts at: `<the next 0/5 minute increment, e.g. Today at 11:40 AM, or Today at 2:45 PM, or Today at 2:50 PM; NOT Today at 10:33 AM>`
        - You can start the timer on any minute increment, but it is easier for most people to remember and predict if it happens on 0/5 minute increments

      - Trigger: `TNS Clock Tock Switch Power Off`
      - Conditions: None
      - Scene: `Turn on TNS Clock Tick Switch Scene`

#### Unresponsive Device Alarm Accessory

#### Ideal State Switch

#### Motion Sensor Cooldown Switch

Purpose: Suppose you have one or more motion sensors that you use to trigger an automation that turns on some lights. How do you trigger the lights to turn off? Some motion sensors come with a customizable motion duration (until they stop reporting motion) that you could leverage, but many don't. Further, if you have multiple motion sensors on the same light trigger, you probably don't want the lights to turn off until `all` of the motion sensors are no longer detecting motion (after a cooldown period that you control). Wouldn't it be great if the lights only turned off after no motion was detected on multiple motion sensors for 5 minutes?

1. Create an accessory with the following configuration ([see 'Add Accessories' steps above](#add-accessories "How to Add Accessories")):

   - For best results you should:
     - Set the motion duration as small as possible on all of your sensors (where applicable)
     - Set a default state revert time that is longer that your sensors' motion duration
   - Use default values for all properties not explicitly noted below.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "TNS Entrance Light(s) Motion Cooldown Switch",
     "switchOneIsCreatable": true,
     "switchOneDefaultStateRevertTime": 300000,
   },
   ```

1. Set the `TNS Entrance Light(s) Motion Cooldown Switch` accessory to run a child bridge

## Plugin Development

### Setup Development Environment

To develop Homebridge plugins you must have Node.js 12 or later installed and a modern code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Install Development Dependencies

Using a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run this command to install the development dependencies:

```sh
npm ci
```

### Build Plugin

TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run. The following command will compile the contents of your [`src`](./src) directory and put the resulting code into the `dist` folder.

```sh
npm run build
```

### Link To Homebridge

Run this command so your global install of Homebridge can discover the plugin in your development environment:

```sh
npm link
```

You can now start Homebridge, use the `-D` flag so you can see debug log messages in your plugin:

```sh
homebridge -D
```

### Watch For Changes and Build Automatically

If you want to have your code compile automatically as you make changes and restart Homebridge automatically between changes you can run:

```sh
npm run watch
```

This will launch an instance of Homebridge in debug mode which will restart every time you make a change to the source code. It will load the config stored in the default location under `~/.homebridge`. You may need to stop other running instances of Homebridge while using this command to prevent conflicts. You can adjust the Homebridge startup command in the [`nodemon.json`](./nodemon.json) file.

### Publish Package

When you are ready to publish the plugin to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) run:

```sh
npm publish
```
